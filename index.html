    <h1>Welcome to Royal Dragons</h1>
    <p> Welcome to Royal Dragons, a friendly and welcoming club where everyone can feel safe, included, and have fun. We
        are a hangout group first, where people come together to relax, laugh, and enjoy the game - but we also offer
        many exciting activities!</p>

    <p> The club was founded on June 1st, 2020, by a brave leader - Athena Sparrowstar (Liz) , later joined by Phoebe
        (Pho) Highhunter, Siri (Stjerne) Raincake and Vanessa (Pinky) Gloomberg, in the magical land of Misty Valley,
        Jorvik. Since then, it has grown into a happy and safe space for all our members.</p>

    <p the world of Royal Dragons, you can take part in many fun disciplines, such as:<br> 
        🐎 Western Drill – ride in patterns as a team<br>

        🎠 Dressage – show your horse’s skill and grace<br>

        🏇 Racing – speed across the land like the wind<br>

        🎭 Roleplay – join us on adventures with our rp stable, Wyrmsgate Stables</p>

        <p>We hold official events 4–5 days a week, with a mix of games, training, and fun challenges. Our amazing
        instructors help players of all levels learn and grow in drill and dressage, host rp lessons through our lesson
        program, and make room for cosy game- and movie nights.</p>

        <p>Even though we focus mostly on having fun and spending time together, we also partake in different competitions.
        You can choose whether you'd like to show off your elegant dressage skills by competing in a dressage routine,
        or grab the horn and partake in a drill routine.</p>

        people from all over Norway, and participate in different meetups if you'd like to meet your besties in real
