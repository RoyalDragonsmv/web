    <h1>Royal Dragons</h1>
    <p> Welcome to Royal Dragons, a friendly and welcoming club where everyone can feel safe, included, and have fun.
        We're first and foremost a hangout club, where people come together to relax, laugh, and enjoy the game - but we
        also offer many exciting activities! You're sure to find something to your liking, either you prefer challenging
        yourself in the arena, roleplaying at the barn or hanging out on other games with friends.<br><br>

        The club was first founded on June 1st, 2020, by a brave leader - Athena Sparrowstar (Liz) under a different
        name, and was later joined by Phoebe (Pho) Highhunter, Siri (Stjerne) Raincake and Vanessa (Pinky) Gloomberg, in
        the magical land of Misty Valley, Jorvik. Five years later, we donned our royal uniforms and revamped into Royal Dragons.
         Since then, it has grown into a happy and safe space for all our members.</p>

    <p> In the world of Royal Dragons, you can take part in many fun disciplines, such as:<br><br>
        🐎 Western Drill – ride in patterns as a team<br>

        🎠 Dressage – show your horse’s skill and grace<br>

        🏇 Racing – speed across the land like the wind<br>

        🎭 Roleplay – join us on adventures with our rp stable, Wyrmsgate Stables </p> 

    <p>We host official events 4–5 days a week, with a mix of games, training, and fun challenges. Our amazing
        instructors help players of all levels learn and grow in drill and dressage, host rp lessons through our lesson
        program, and make room for cosy game- and movie nights. Additionally, we host a plethora of optional events
        scattered throughout the week, and you'll find people in call and chat any time of day.<br><br>

    <    Whilst our main focus is on having fun and spending time together, we also partake in different competitions
        throughout the year. Our talented instructors create intricate routines and help our riders shine in the
        spotlight. We offer competition teams in both drill and dressage, and it's up to you if you wish to show off
        your elegant dressage skills or grab the horn and yeehaw your way into a drill routine. There's something for
        everyone.<br><br>

        No matter what you enjoy most, we promise there is a place for you. Our members find their forever home, and
        people rarely leave. You'll get to know friends from all over Norway, and we host a variety of meetups all over
        the country! While there's no must to attend meetups and real life gatherings, we find that many of our members
        find new friends for life and hangout more often after attending a meetup together. Whether you're looking for
        friends, fun, or a little adventure - the gates of Royal Dragons are always open.<br><br>

        Come ride with us, and become part of a legend! 🐉 </p>
