<h1>Welcome to Royal Dragons</h1>
<p>Welcome to Royal Dragons, a friendly and welcoming club where everyone can feel safe, included, 
and have fun. We are a hangout group first, where people come together to relax, laugh, and enjoy the 
game - but we also offer many exciting activities!</p> 

<p>The club was founded on June 1st, 2020, by a brave leader - Athena Sparrowstar (Liz), later joined 
by Phoebe (Pho) Highhunter, Siri (Stjerne) Raincake and Vanessa (Pinky) Gloomberg, in the magical 
land of Misty Valley, Jorvik. Since then, it has grown into a happy and safe space for all our members.</p>

<p>In the world of Royal Dragons, you can take part in many fun disciplines, such as:
🐎 Western Drill – ride in patterns as a team

🎠 Dressage – show your horse’s skill and grace

🏇 Racing – speed across the land like the wind

🎭 Roleplay – join us on adventures with our rp stable, wyrmsgate stables</p>
